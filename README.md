Configures and Operates all of the Components on the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2 Board

This repository contains two separate folders:

'Final Code' contains three files: "execution.ino", "variables.h" and "functions.h", which operate coherently when uploaded to the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2 Board.

'Test Functions' contains many files, all of which work individually and operate to perform a specific task, described at the beginning of the file.

Refer to the descriptions provided in all files, in order to build the appropriate circuits and collect the best results.
