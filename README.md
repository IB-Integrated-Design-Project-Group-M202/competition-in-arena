Configures and Operates all of the Components on the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2 Board

This main folder contains most of the test functions, which are used by the final code.
Please refer to the 'Final Code' folder to find the "execution.ino", "variables.h" and "functions.h" files.
These files work coherently, when uploaded to the Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev 2 Board, which is connected in an appropriate circuit.
