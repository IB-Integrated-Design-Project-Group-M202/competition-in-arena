This repository contains two separate folders:

'Final Code' contains three files, which combine to operate the robot coherently during the competition in the arena.

'Test Functions' contains many files, which work individually to perform a task, described at the beginning of the file.

Refer to the descriptions provided in all files, in order to build the appropriate circuits and collect the best results.
